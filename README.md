# ExampleBot
Example Discord bot, written using discord.py, love and Python. These are actually the barebones of a project I'm working on.

# Features
The only features currently available in my bot is a cog manager, a reload function which allows people to reload their cogs without having to open up a new Python instance and a basic ping command which is usable by everyone. Feel free to experiment with it, just make sure to credit me for my work!
